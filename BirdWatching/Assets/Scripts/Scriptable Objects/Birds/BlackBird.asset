  description: The common blackbird is a species of true thrush. It is also called
    the Eurasian blackbird, or simply the blackbird where this does not lead to confusion
    with a similar-looking local species. It breeds in Europe, western Asia, and
    North Africa, and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand.
