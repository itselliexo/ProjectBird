  description: A crow is a bird of the genus Corvus, or more broadly, a synonym for
    all of Corvus. The word "crow" is used as part of the common name of many species.
    The related term "raven" is not linked scientifically to any certain trait but
    is rather a general grouping for larger-sized species of Corvus.
